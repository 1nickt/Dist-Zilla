# PREREQ OVERHAUL

Allow all META 2.0 phases and relationship types.

...but not optional features, which are an abomination.

...and maybe not "conflicts."

finalization of prereqs should replace the Version::Requirements objects with
ones that still respond to add/etc, but throw if the new requirement does not
fit the existing specs.

## TODO

* add a means to say "my installed version"
